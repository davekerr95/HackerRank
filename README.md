#HackerRank Solutions

Username: davekerr95

###Introduction
These are the solutions to any HackerRank competitions and other questions, I have a keen interest in doing HackerRank / Other Coding competitions and challenges.

(Currently I haven't had much time to continue any of my solutions in progress thus why not alot of solutions are present)

All of my solutions are done in Java

I have currently participated in several competitions including Google HashCode, MINDS Programmathon 2015, Maynooth Department of Computer Science Programmathon 2016 and the HackerRank May Code Sprint 2016

###Future Plans
I plan to complete the challenges in Algorithms, Data Structures, Artificial Intelligence, Java and Security as these are the areas I am currently interested in.
